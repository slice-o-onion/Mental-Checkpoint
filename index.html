Excitement is a surge of additional energy developed primarily to enable an organism to act more promptly. However:

Excitement can be experienced even if an action is not needed or before it is needed. This usually happens when we expect or imagine something, and it may lead to a slippery slope if excitement and these images create a vicious circle.
Intense excitement can diminish attention and concentration as well as lead to distorted perception and judgements.

It can also amplify emotional responses (so joy becomes euphoria, fear becomes panic, anger becomes rage).
Excitement affects self-control, can cause unpredictable reactions and increase susceptibility to influence.

A persistently high level of excitement may even affect physical and mental health.
Moderate excitement is desirable though, often sought to counter boredom. What would life be without getting excited? However, if excitement becomes a need or an end in itself, it can be addictive and lead to prioritising intensity over quality – which, in fact, increases boredom in the long run.
Evidently, excitement plays a complex role in our lives, so let’s see what we can do about it.

''Managing excitement''
One common way of controlling excitement is trying to restrain its expression (its visibility) – usually in order to leave a good impression. This rarely works though; suppressing excitement is easy to recognise and it just adds to inner pressure (like putting a lid on a pot of boiling water). Furthermore, suppression does not strengthen your ability to regulate excitement itself, as suppression only deals with its expression. Some people resort to props such as alcohol, cigarettes and the like but this has some shortcomings too: these things are not always available or appropriate, you can develop dependency, they are mostly unhealthy, and they too don’t strengthen your capacity to regulate excitement but, in fact, weaken it. So what else can be done? Two things: you can prepare for challenging situations in this respect and you can use some techniques to reduce excitement.

And, becoming enamoured with a certain subject or person can be so fun and exciting! Our energy goes totally towards that one thing.

''3. Journal''
If you don’t have a bestie to talk to, talk to your journal! You can write something like “Dear diary, today I discovered that horses actually DO sleep lying down!” So, if no one is around to hear about your newest love, journal alllll about it! 

''4. Meditate''
Sometimes, even during all the excitement of discovering a new hobby, a new love, or a new interest, you just need to take some time to reflect on it. If you meditate on this feeling of excitement and fascination, you can then learn to continually apply it to other aspects of your life!

Even if we don’t think so at the moment, we might look back on something and laugh at how ridiculous it was. It doesn’t happen often, but when it does, you feel sooo at ease afterwards. Laughter can provide stress relief and it’s been proven that feeling joy is good for your mental and physical health. 

So, whenever you’re having a bad day try to find some amusement to lighten it up. Maybe watch an episode of your go-to funny show (our personal faves are Parks &amp; Rec or Brooklyn Nine-Nine). Read some dad jokes online. Watch funny cat videos or scroll through TikTok. Speaking of those positive benefits, let’s take a look at alllll the ways that feeling amused is good for our health…

''How Feeling Amused Shows Up Mentally''
Feeling amused is rooted in one very key emotion: happiness! Here are some positive symptoms you might experience when you’re feeling amused:

* Improved mood
* Reduced stress and anxiety
* Increased attentiveness and focus
* Boost in productivity
* Spark of creativity
* Improved analytical skills
* More good thoughts
* Increased motivation


''5 Ways to Embrace Feeling Amused''

These strategies are for embracing this emotion to the fullest, and can even be used when you’re NOT feeling so amused and need a lil’ pick-me-up.

''1. Journal''
Journaling is a great practice for staying in tune with our emotions. So, try writing down exactly how you’re feeling and what made you feel this way. Can’t stop smiling because you received a nice compliment? Laughing at an old memory that popped into your head? On those days where you’re not feeling so great, you can look back at these entries and find a little bit of light. 


''2. Visualize Your Happy Place''
We all have that happy place in our minds. It could be a cozy bookstore on the snowy mountainside with a crackling fireplace. Maybe it’s the beach where you sun-bathed during your last vacay. Whatever your happy place is, go there in your mind! Picturing someplace that makes you feel at peace can help keep that good mood going.


''3. Connect with a Friend''
One of the best things about feeling amused? Sharing that amusement with your best pals! When was the last time you goofed around? Plan a fun night with zero discussion about work, school or any other stressors in your life right now. Friends are great for venting but why not dedicate a whole day/night to let go of all of the heavy shit and just have fun?! The goofier the activity, the better! Try dressing up and speaking in silly voices all night. Or, go to the dog park (even if you don’t have a dog) so you can soak in all the cuteness together!


''4. Engage in Something Creative''
Another way to channel this amusement? Get creative! Try your hand at drawing, calligraphy, painting, writing, practicing an instrument, singing, dancing…you get the idea! This a fun zone and a judgement-free zone! You get to be creative however you like.


''5. Practice Gratitude''
Gratitude can look like simply taking notice of the good things in life and showing them appreciation. That might involve writing a list of things that bring you joy, volunteering in your community, or showing acts of kindness to the people who make your life better. Whatever it may be, gratitude is the gift that keeps on givin’.

It’s the child-like, care-free part of ourselves that we don’t get to unleash very often. When we’re playful, we like to get a lil’ silly. We crack jokes and laugh. Yeah sure, work is important too…but you know how the saying goes: all work and no play makes everything seem pretty fucking dull (no, that’s not the exact quote but we’re gonna roll with it anyway).

If you’re feeling playful right now and wanna learn more about how this emotion impacts your mental wellbeing, then you’ve come to the right place! Let’s dive through feeling playful, ‘as it’s a super underrated emotion that we should defs appreciate to the fullest.

For a lot of us, we probably associate playfulness with being a kid. But really though, all kids know is running around the playground, dressing up, playing games and making up stories. So of course they’re the epitome of playfulness: their whooole life is about play!

For adults, though? Playtime doesn’t come so easily for us, and it’s not just for lack of trying. Hellooo, we’ve got responsibilities! Places to be! Bills to pay! Who’s got the time for fun nowadays? But I'm here to remind you that feeling playful is possible in everyday life, even for busy and hardworking badasses such as yourself! Sure, you’ve probably got a lot on the go. Chances are, you can’t just drop work or school at a moment’s notice to run away on a fun trip (it’s okay to admit you fantasize about it sometimes tho)!

Tapping into that playful side of yourself is great for your mental wellbeing and can help you let go of some of that stress, anxiety or burnout you might be struggling with. Don’t believe us? Just take a look at all of the benefits!


''5 Ways to Embrace Feeling Playful''
Now let’s get to the best part: some strategies for embracing your playful side! We promise this isn’t like homework or anything. We’re trying to have fun here, remember?! So try some of these practices out for yourself and unleash that playful side of you that’s been waiting to come out!

''1. Move Your Body''
We’ve got one word for you: endorphins. We know that exercise boosts endorphins, which make you happy! Even if physical activity isn’t your fave thing, there’s lots of fun ways to get active. Go for a walk, run, swim, bike, rock climbing, yoga, you name it. Dance around your room to a fun playlist like nobody’s watching, if that’s more your style! Whatever way you like, just get movin’ and groovin’. It’s worth it!

''2. Engage in Compassionate Self Talk''
Like we said before, finding our playful side can be a challenge. Especially when you’re stuck in the same routine, same responsibilities, blah blah blah. But news flash: you’re not a boring person! You never were, nor will you ever be. You might just need to shake things up! Try these compassionate self talk phrases: I have a hard time finding my playful side sometimes but that’s okay. I can get through this rut. My life isn’t all about work or other responsibilities. I can get shit done, and still have fun! (Hey that rhymed!)

''3. Connect with a Friend''
One of the best things about feeling playful is sharing that upbeat energy with your best pals! When was the last time you goofed around? Here’s an idea: plan a fun night with zero discussion about work, school or any other stressors in your life right now. Friends are great for venting but why not dedicate a whole day/night to let go of all of the heavy shit and just have fun?! Give each other wild makeovers, make up a funny song or have a dance party in your living room. The goofier the activity, the better!

''4. Engage in Something Creative''
Another great way to channel your playfulness? Gettin’ creative is a great method! Try your hand at drawing, sketching, doing calligraphy or painting. Write poems or stories. Practice an instrument, sing, dance! Feeling playful can help break down some of the walls you might put up around yourself. This a fun zone and a judgement-free zone! You get to be creative however you like.

''5. Practice Gratitude''
Showing gratitude for the things that bring us happiness and provide us with tons of energy?! Yeppp, that’s the best! Gratitude can look like simply taking notice of the good things in life and showing them appreciation. That might involve writing a list of things that bring you joy, volunteering in your community, or showing acts of kindness to the people who make your life better. Whatever it may be, gratitude feels great for everyone!

You are on the right path in your journey, and it is a very freeing feeling to be optimistic about the future. Positivity is one of the best outlooks for the future. 

While optimism is a healthy attribute, being overly optimistic in the face of adversity can be toxic and negatively influence your emotional wellness. Positive thinking improves life outcomes and reduces the likelihood of suicide ideation and behavior, but toxic positivity forces people to disregard negative emotions. Suppressing emotions can lead to emotional outbursts and contribute to irritability, anxiety, and depression.

Toxic positivity happens when positive reasoning turns into a fixation, constraining individuals to stay quiet about their sentiments. Toxic positivity causes avoidance and quells sentiments by preventing experiencing certain emotions.

Problems are tough to fix just by simply remaining positive and having an uplifting perspective. Rather than retreating from a situation, one should confront it and seek solutions.

''Toxic Positivity: Indicators''
You can identify a few toxic positivity indications, expressions, or events in your daily life. The following are a few instances.

* Hiding honest feelings regarding terrible circumstances
* By smothering sentiments, endeavoring to move on with the situation
* Feeling repentant for how you feel
* Rather than affirming someone’s feelings, attempt to convince them that the circumstance might be more dreadful 
* Rather than paying attention to somebody, attempt to reassure them by showing idealistic viewpoints
* Shaming people for displaying emotions other than happiness


''How to Cope With Toxic Positivity''

The following are some techniques for minimizing self-inflicted toxic positivity:

* Consider your unpleasant mood to be natural, and see it as a typical element of being mortal to express particular emotions in certain situations.
* Rather than avoiding your feelings, acknowledge them.
* Conveying and expressing your views to individuals who are willing to listen without passing judgment.
* To discover mental health difficulties, seek help as soon as possible by chatting with a therapist.

To prevent putting toxic positivity on others, one should:

* Encourage others so that they can honestly express their emotions in front of you without worrying about what you think.
* Instead of focusing on the positive, learn to recognize and understand negative emotions.
* Avoid the temptation to respond positively to whatever a person says


Allowing somebody to solely share good considerations may restrict correspondence and cause them to feel repulsive about themselves for having negative thoughts. Instead, aid those persons in listening to them so that they can expose their traumas or mental health issue and get therapy assistance.

All in all, feeling optimistic can be a euphoric feeling, but while encouraged, be careful about being overly positive and try to manage your expectations. You got this!

Brain fog describes a mental fuzziness or lack of clarity.

When dealing with it, you might experience:

* trouble putting thoughts together
* difficulty concentrating or remembering what you were doing
* physical or mental exhaustion
* lack of motivation and interest in the things you’d usually do
* thoughts that seem hazy or difficult to grasp


''While brain fog is pretty common, it’s not a condition on its own. But it can be a symptom of several issues — anxiety and stress among them.''


Even if you don’t actively focus on anxious thoughts, they often still run in the background of your brain and might contribute to physical symptoms like uneasiness, stomach upset, or fatigue.

Anxiety-related brain fog doesn’t just make it hard to get things done. It can also give you another thing to feel anxious about, especially if it’s been happening for a while.

''Trace it back to the source''
Identifying the causes of brain fog can help you figure out how to address it more effectively.Temporary sources of stress — like a big project at work — can contribute to mental fatigue. Those causes are often fairly easy to identify.But if you’ve been dealing with anxiety or stress for a while, you might have a harder time recognizing what’s affecting you.

If you can’t quite pinpoint what’s creating all the background noise in your mind, working with a therapist can be a big help (more on this later).

''Get more sleep''
Sleep deprivation can make it difficult to think clearly during the day, regardless of whether or not you’re dealing with anxiety.A night or two of less sleep than usual probably won’t have a long lasting impact, as long as you get enough sleep most nights.But if you regularly don’t get enough sleep, you’ll likely start to notice some negative consequences, including irritability, daytime sleepiness, and — you guessed it — difficulty concentrating.

Caffeine can help you feel more alert temporarily, but it’s not a good permanent solution. Aiming for at least 7 hours of sleep every night is a good start, but you may need up to 9 hours for optimal function.


''Check on your physical needs ''
Not eating enough, or not getting the right nutrients, can make it difficult to focus.
When stressed, you might feel too tired to prepare balanced meals and turn to snacks or fast food instead. These foods typically don’t offer much in the way of energy boosting nutrients. In fact, they might have the opposite effect, making you feel tired and lethargic.Anxiety can also contribute to stomach problems that make it difficult to eat like you normally would. If you skip a few meals, you might end up feeling nauseous at the thought of food, which can drain you even more.

''Develop a stress management plan''
Stress happens to everyone, so identifying a few go-to coping strategies is a smart investment.

Try:

* Setting boundaries to protect time for self-care.
* Getting comfortable saying “no” to requests for help when you’re already busy.
* Thinking of three ways to manage stressful situations anywhere. (Breathing exercises can be a good place to start.)
* Journaling about your mood and emotions.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="discouraged" tags="" position="1500,1100" size="100,100">Discouragement comes in different forms. A mother tells her children they could not do sports because they do not have the build. It could also be a friend criticizing you for applying for a managerial position or a spouse stopping you from doing business. They may be truthful in a way but their discouragement hurts and disheartens you.

The simplest definition of discouragement is losing confidence and enthusiasm in doing something. When you are discouraged by people, especially those who are close to you, you feel so many negative emotions. You become sad, confused, scared, uncertain and worried. 

These tips may help you out: 

''1.  Know your strengths.''
Most times, people discourage you from doing something because they think that you do not have the ability or the intelligence. It sounds like they are belittling you but they are doing it with good intentions. But still, it pains you to hear negative words.

Knowing your strengths and skills allow you to do the things that you know you can do. Enhance your strengths to be better no matter what other people say. If you feel that you still need to improve, take time to hone your skills. You can achieve anything as long as you work hard for it.

''2. Surround yourself with optimistic people.''
One of the best ways to overcome discouragement is to stay away from people who have nothing else to say but judgment and harsh criticisms. Some people discourage you because they are jealous and are afraid that you will be more successful than them. Whatever their reasons may be, stay away from people who only see your flaws.

Optimistic people radiate good vibes which you need to have a happy and successful life. The last thing you need is to be surrounded by people who will constantly rain on your parade.

''3. Remember all your victories and achievements.''
Experiencing failure is part of life because this is how you learn to stand up and try again. Whether you have failed and been discouraged countless times, you must bear in mind that you are not a failure. These are just humps that you have to go through to grow and mature.Whenever you face failure and discouragement, recollect all the good memories and the wondrous feeling when you won the spelling bee, got accepted into your dream school, or placed first place in a dance contest. Use your past achievements as a basis that you can do anything as long as you put your mind and heart to it.

Overcoming discouragement can be difficult to handle especially if you are used to winning. Oftentimes, experiencing failure leads you to believe that you are incompetent and worthless. Remember that what you experience now is your stepping stone towards your ambition.

Overcoming discouragement requires a strong will and a positive mindset. ''The moment you allow discouragement to conquer your thoughts, you will surely fail. Let all negativities slide because they are there to mold you into the best version of yourself.''

Depression can sometimes be the cause of discouragement. Keep your mind healthy but if things become unbearable, seek help from medical professionals.

These feelings generally have nothing to do with our actual performance or abilities. In fact, these feelings may have a lot more to do with low self-esteem or low self-confidence than any objective measure of ability or competence.

The American Psychological Association defines an inadequacy complex (more commonly known as an inferiority complex) as a feeling of inadequacy or insecurity coming from actual or imagined physical or psychological deficiencies. This feeling of being “less than” or “inferior to” others can often cause us to shut down (withdraw) or act aggressively depending on our coping styles.

People who feel inadequate may also experience the following things:

* Withdrawn/shy/quiet(see[[distant]])
* Insecurity
* Negativity(see[[frustrated]])
* Unhappiness
* Anger/hostility(see categories in [[Mad]])
* Low motivation(see[[apathetic]])


''How to Overcome Feelings of Inadequacy''
If you’re feeling inadequate in general—or about something in particular—research shows that a number of strategies can help you feel better:

''Modify your expectations and ideals.'' 
If we’re constantly falling short of our expectations and ideals, it may be that we have unrealistic expectations of ourselves and what we can reasonably accomplish.
Seek help from others. Get help with the things you struggle with. If you don’t feel capable and you know someone who could teach you what you need to know, reaching out to them can be helpful.


''Build skills and expertise''.
If you’re feeling inadequate on a particular task, take the time to build your skills. Over time, you’ll feel more competent and capable. No one is good at everything right away, so try not to get down on yourself for being a beginner at something (Lindqvist, Weurlander, Wernerson, &amp; Thornberg, 2017).


''Cultivate emotion regulation skills.''
We often feel most inadequate in difficult situations (Lindqvist, Weurlander, Wernerson, &amp; Thornberg, 2017). But, if we learn effective ways to regulate our emotions in these situations, they can be easier to manage and we’ll reduce negative emotions. (Negative emotions can actually impair our ability to make decisions and think clearly, which can fuel inadequacy.)


''Practice self-compassion''.
Regardless of how competent we are at a given task, we have value and are worthy of self-kindness. Practice showing yourself self-compassion and using loving-kindness meditation to grow your love for yourself and others.

''Build a growth mindset. ''
A growth mindset is when we believe we have the ability to grow and improve. This mindset helps us more easily overcome skill deficits. We know we can improve so we put more effort into improving ourselves. As a result, we can end up more skilled than we ever imagined.

''Focus on your strengths. ''
We all have strengths. By finding your strengths and capitalizing on them, you focus your attention more on what you’re good at than what you’re not good at. Plus, you can put your strengths to work and succeed in areas that rely on these strengths.



It’s totally normal to feel inadequate from time to time. If we work at it, we can reduce the amount of time we spend feeling this way and we can leave more room for self-confidence. Implementing any of these strategies can help you feel more competent and comfortable in situations that might produce inadequacy.

Nearly everyone experiences embarrassment from time to time. Whether you’ve said something you didn’t mean, made a mistake, or had an awkward social moment, you aren’t alone. Embarrassment can make you feel self-conscious and often involves feeling out of place, shameful, or uncomfortable in a social situation.

''Long-term trouble dealing with shame or fear of embarrassment can lead to additional complications, such as anxiety disorders, depression, or lowered self-esteem.
''
Embarrassing moments don’t have to stick with you forever. By applying these tips and tricks, you can move forward with your life with greater ease after an embarrassing event.
Sometimes a few deep breaths, a small joke, and a kind word to yourself can turn an embarrassing event into a funny story you tell at parties.

Additionally, seeking professional help from a mental health professional when you feel stuck with shame, guilt, or fear can be beneficial for not letting embarrassment control your life.

Whether it be with work, school, social obligations or just life in general, we all feel overwhelmed, anxious, or stressed at some point. It’s important to give yourself grace when you have these feelings. Try not to brush them off or push through whatever is causing you to feel anxious – your mental health matters and if you’re feeling the squeeze, understand that you can take a step back.

We understand that recent events along with the COVID-19 pandemic have made things complicated, and it can be difficult to juggle all of your responsibilities at the same time. When you’re starting to feel overwhelmed, remember that you can always revisit your self-care plan. Self-care plans are personal, which can be just the thing for when things feel like too much. Try some of these tips when you’re feeling overwhelmed:

''Take a deep breath and step away. ''
If you’re feeling overwhelmed or anxious, a quick way to begin to alleviate those feelings is by doing breathing exercises. If the thing that’s overwhelming you is in front of you, try taking a step away from it to create some separation between you and whatever is making you feel this way. Deep breathing exercises are a great way to promote relaxation and lower your stress response. 


''Create a “no” list.''
Protecting your time and space can help give you a sense of control over your schedule. If you don’t want to do something or have been dreading that virtual happy hour, don’t feel like you have to go. Replace the activities you don’t want to do with something that you’ll enjoy. Healthy boundaries are crucial for your wellbeing!
Be kind to yourself. Remember that feeling overwhelmed is OK, especially now. It also helps to remember that feeling overwhelmed doesn’t have to last. Give yourself some grace – if you don’t get to that chore or have to ask for an extension at work, you can. Your mental health should be a top priority.


''Ask for help from a loved one.''
Your social support network is there for you to lean on if you need to vent or talk things through. Reach out to a friend for a virtual chat or pick up the phone and call a family member.


''Write it out.''
Writing down why you feel overwhelmed or anxious is another great way to help alleviate those feelings. It helps to do this unstructured – having a written stream of consciousness allows you to express yourself freely and getting those thoughts out of your head will be a relief.

A feeling of trust in your abilities, qualities, and judgment? Sign us up. The American Psychological Association defines self-confidence as &quot;a belief that one is capable of successfully meeting the demands of a task.&quot;

But cultivating and maintaining confidence isn't easy and it's an easy thing to lose when you feel like you've failed or made a mistake. That's why actively working on building up your self-confidence is so crucial, it's something you have to maintain. As cheesy as it sounds, you do have to believe in yourself!

Ways to Be More Confident
Having a healthy level of self-confidence can help you become more successful in your personal and professional life. Your level of confidence even affects how you present yourself to others.

Whether you lack confidence in one specific area or struggle to feel confident about anything, these tips can help you be more confident

''Surround Yourself With Positive People''
he people you spend time with can influence your thoughts and attitudes about yourself, perhaps more than you realize. So, pay attention to how others make you feel. If you feel bad about yourself after hanging out with a particular person, it may be time to say goodbye. 

Instead, surround yourself with people who love you and want the best for you. Seek out others who are positive and can help build your confidence. Self-confidence and a positive attitude go hand-in-hand.

''Be Kind to Yourself''
Self-compassion involves treating yourself with kindness when you make a mistake, fail, or experience a setback. It allows you to become more emotionally flexible and helps you better navigate challenging emotions, enhancing your connection to yourself and others.

''Take Care of Your Body''
When you practice self-care, you know you're doing something positive for your mind, body, and spirit—and you'll naturally feel more confident as a result. Diet,exercise, meditation, and sleep can help maintain your mental and physical well-being,

''Face Your Fears''
Stop putting things off until you feel more self-confident—like asking someone on a date or applying for a promotion. One of the best ways to build your confidence in these situations is by facing your fears head-on.11

Practice facing some of your fears that stem from a lack of self-confidence. If you’re afraid you’ll embarrass yourself or think that you’re going to mess up, try anyway. A little self-doubt can even help improve performance.

 Tell yourself it’s just an experiment and see what happens.


All in all, you're doing great!

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="58" name="discerning" tags="" position="1100,1100" size="100,100">Developing discernment is a crucial skill that can change your life for the better. It is the ability to make wise judgments and decisions, especially in complex situations where there may be conflicting information or competing interests. Discernment allows you to evaluate situations objectively, identify potential risks, and determine the best course of action. It is a skill that can be developed and honed over time, and the benefits are tremendous.

In today's fast-paced world, where we are bombarded with an overwhelming amount of information and choices, it is crucial to develop effective decision-making skills. Making wise decisions requires more than just logical reasoning; it demands a deeper level of insight and discernment. Discernment, the ability to judge and understand details clearly, empowers us to make choices that align with our values, goals, and overall well-being. In this section, we will explore how cultivating discernment can enhance our decision-making abilities and provide practical tips and examples to help you develop this skill.

''1. Seeking Multiple Perspectives and Gathering Information''

Developing effective decision-making skills through discernment involves seeking multiple perspectives and gathering information from various sources. When faced with a challenging decision, it can be beneficial to consult trusted mentors, friends, or experts in the field. Their insights and experiences can provide valuable perspectives that we may not have considered.

''2. Evaluating the Consequences and long-Term implications''

Discernment goes beyond short-term gains and focuses on evaluating the consequences and long-term implications of our decisions. It requires us to consider not only our immediate desires but also the potential impact our choices may have on ourselves and others.

''3. Reflecting on Past Decisions and Learning from Mistakes''

Developing effective decision-making skills is an ongoing process that requires reflection and learning from past decisions. By analyzing the outcomes of our choices, we can gain valuable insights into our decision-making patterns and areas for improvement.


Putting discernment into practice is a process that requires effort and intentionality. By identifying your biases, gathering information, considering the consequences, seeking advice, and practicing self-reflection, you can apply your wisdom to real-life situations effectively.

Tips for embracing discernment as a lifelong journey include ''seeking out diverse viewpoints, engaging in respectful discussions, and continuously expanding our knowledge base.'' By actively seeking out perspectives that differ from our own, we can challenge our preconceived notions and gain a broader understanding of complex issues. Engaging in respectful discussions with others who hold different opinions can also help us refine our own arguments and expose any potential flaws in our thinking. Lastly, committing to lifelong learning ensures that we are constantly expanding our knowledge and staying up to date with the latest developments in various fields.

I'm glad you feel valuable.  If you can get into the habit of using self-evaluation tools to measure your own concrete actions against clear, measurable goals, you will put yourself squarely on the path to continuous improvement. Scorekeeping will double as a great source of ongoing, real-time documentation.

This is why you should care about creating the habit of regular self-evaluation: Research studies show that what really drives learning and growth is real self-awareness through regular, productive, honest self-evaluation against clear standards. That is the fundamental building block for systematically learning any skill.

Without evaluating yourself against some measuring stick, it is very hard to set meaningful, concrete goals for improvement, much less monitor your progress on the way toward meeting those goals. If you want to run far, you should measure your distance. If you want to run fast, you should measure your distance over time. If you want to run smarter, you should measure your training regimen against established best practices. If you want to run for charity, then you need to measure how much money you raise.

The key is to get in the habit of regular self-evaluation against external standards to build greater self-awareness to support your own learning and growth going forward. Remember, the mirror is the best teacher if you learn how to use it to measure your own performance against concrete goals for improvement.

Try this three-step exercise to get started on the path to greater self-evaluation.

''1. Brainstorm''. 
Give self-evaluation as broad a definition as you can. Then ask yourself: What does it mean to your boss? Your organization? Your colleagues? And, most importantly, what does it mean to you? Where do these various definitions align, and where do they differ?

''2. Think of examples''
. Are there individuals at your organization who exemplify this approach to regular self-evaluation, whether inside or outside of work? Can you describe these examples in detail? What happened? Where? When? Who was involved?

''3. Draw on your history. ''
Can you think of a time when you exemplified this approach to regular self-evaluation, inside or outside of work? Can you describe the example in detail? What happened? Where? When? Who else was involved?


Overall, you're doing great! Keep on with your journey, traveler.

While everyone feels guilty at times, excessive feelings of regret can interfere with your everyday life. These feelings can be overwhelming, but thankfully, with the right support and tools like online therapy, you can learn how to deal with guilt in a healthy way. 

If you’re dealing with guilt, keep reading to discover coping strategies that can help you move past that negative feeling. The following tips explore some of the most effective ways to manage guilt in healthy, productive ways.

''1. Determine the Source ''
People can experience guilty feelings for many reasons. Guilt can help us to learn from our mistakes and change negative behaviors, but it can also be toxic or irrational. An important part of overcoming guilt is figuring out why you’re experiencing these feelings in the first place. 

''2. Be Open About Your Feelings''
Don’t bottle up your emotions, even if you feel ashamed of your behavior. Living with guilt is easier when you acknowledge and discuss the things you’re feeling. Consider talking about your feelings with someone you trust. 

''3. Find Ways to Make Amends''
Guilt can be a painful emotion, but it can eventually lead to positive outcomes. Research consistently shows that guilt motivates people to remedy a past mistake. If you’re struggling with guilty feelings about past behaviors, work to make things right with the people that you’ve hurt. 

''4. Practice Self-Compassion ''
It’s important to be kind to yourself, even when you feel like you’ve done something wrong. Think about how you would respond to a friend who’s struggling with the same emotions that you’re experiencing. Instead of beating yourself up for your mistakes, treat yourself with patience and kindness. 

''5. Focus On the Things You Can Control''
After identifying the source of your guilt, consider if there’s anything you can do to improve the situation. While taking action can be an effective way of dealing with guilt, it might be helpful to acknowledge that some situations are simply beyond your control. Instead of ruminating on things you can’t change, try redirecting your energy to things you have some control over. 

''6. Consider What You’d Do Differently Next Time''
There’s no way to change past events, but thinking about what you’d do differently can keep you from making the same mistakes in the future. How would you behave if you had the chance to turn back the clock? While you shouldn’t obsess over the past, it can be helpful to look back at past events constructively. 

''7. Stop Negative Self-Talk''
Not only can self-criticism make guilty feelings worse, but it can also be damaging to your physical and mental well-being, according to research. Try to become more aware of your negative self-talk and challenge your beliefs. When engaging in self-criticism, try to shift to positive self-talk instead. 

''8. Establish Healthy Boundaries'' 
You don’t have to feel guilty for saying no or setting aside time for yourself. An essential part of learning how to deal with guilt is setting healthy relationship boundaries with the people in your life. Having clear boundaries can help you advocate for yourself and avoid guilty feelings. 

''9. Treat Mistakes as Opportunities ''
Mistakes can lead to negative outcomes, but they can also be valuable learning opportunities. If you’ve done something wrong, acknowledge it and think about how you can make different choices in the future. Reframing a past mistake and treating your missteps can be a chance to grow. 

''10. Learn to Forgive Yourself''
Overcoming guilt isn’t easy when you’ve done something that’s hurt people you care about. While you should take responsibility for your behavior, you shouldn’t forget that you’re worthy of forgiveness. Forgiving yourself can help you move on from guilty feelings and work on self-improvement.



''Try to get Help''
If you can’t figure out how to cope with the guilt you’re feeling, it might be time to discuss your feelings with a mental health professional. Unhealthy guilt can be a symptom of depression, and persistent guilty feelings are sometimes linked to trauma. Therapy can be a way to acknowledge, address, and let go of guilt and mitigate its effect on your life.

Do you feel like you’re worthless, and just not ‘good enough’? Or do you hide the ‘real you’ and present a false self to the world? Maybe you’ve even started avoiding social situations because other people’s apparent confidence and success makes you feel bad about yourself. Do you ever ask yourself: “Why do I feel inferior?”

We all feel like we don’t measure up sometimes – usually as a result of a specific, temporary situation. But if you always feel like this, it’s possible you have an inferiority complex. Here’s what it is – and what to do about it.

''What is an inferiority complex?''
An inferiority complex is not the same as noticing that someone can do something better than you. We all have moments of feeling that other people are more capable or successful than us. It’s how we respond to those feelings that’s important. Do you reflect and feel motivated to pursue your own goals? Or do you get caught in a spiral of rumination, self-blame and inadequacy? Does it feel like a confirmation of a pattern – and your belief in your own inherent inferiority? Do you always feel inferior?

The American Psychological Association (APA) defines an inferiority complex as: “A basic feeling of inadequacy and insecurity, deriving from actual or imagined physical or psychological deficiency.” It’s a term that dates back to 1907, when psychoanalyst Alfred Adler used it to explain why so many people seem to lack the motivation to act in their own best interest and pursue their goals in life. Today, we tend to call it ‘low self-esteem’.


''Inferiority complex – how to overcome it''
To start to overcome your feelings of inferiority, try the following:

''Make fewer comparisons''. If you find the endless social media scroll is making you feel inferior, try to restrict the time you spend on these platforms – and the people you follow. And don’t feel you have to ‘live up’ to other people – whether idealised media images or your own friends. Everyone is on their own path, and no one really knows what struggles other people have. Identify your own values and goals – and focus on those.

''Practice gratitude. ''Research shows that if you’re grateful for the good things in your life you’ll tend to make fewer comparisons with other people. What are you grateful for? Make a list. Everyone has things to be grateful for.

''Challenge your thinking.'' One of the most effective things you can do is to challenge any unhelpful thinking styles and negative thoughts that leave you feeling inferior, unworthy and defective. This is something that therapy can help with.

''Don’t rely on positive affirmations''. This sounds counterintuitive, as we’re often told that repeating positive affirmations can boost self-esteem. But research shows that, while this may work for people who are already confident, if you have low self-esteem it can make you feel worse. Challenging your thinking is more effective.

''Give yourself a chance.'' If you tend to avoid situations where you could fail or might feel inadequate, try instead to put yourself in situations where realistic achievements are possible.

''Practice self-acceptance''. Own your flaws and insecurities. No one’s perfect. And that’s OK. Give yourself a break.



''Inferiority complex treatment – how can therapy help?''
Because low self-esteem is associated with anxiety and depression, seeking help for these problems may help you overcome feelings of inferiority.

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) can be especially helpful for challenging unhelpful thinking styles; and Schema Therapy can help you understand the roots of any persistent negative patterns or ‘lifetraps’. A therapist can also provide strategies, skills and coping mechanisms to help you.

Loneliness may happen as a natural consequence of isolation, of course, but you can have a thriving network of friends and loved ones and still feel lonely from time to time. Still, like loneliness, isolation can have a far-reaching impact on your overall well-being. Read on to learn a few signs of social isolation to pay attention to, how it might affect your everyday life, and what you can do forge new bonds.

Humans need company to help keep their stress levels in check. Without company, you may grow anxious or mistrustful of the world around you. A 2019 study found a lack of social stimulation can prompt your brain to become hypersensitive to sensory information, like the sound of doors opening. You may find that everyday sights and sounds now put you on edge.

Human contact also helps you maintain a sense of reality. Your sense of self is defined, in part, by how you interact with others. Without anyone to witness or react to your actions, you may start to feel like nothing you do matters. You may wonder where reality ends and your imagination begins.

Research from 2020 examining the impact of solitary confinement for people in correctional facilities found intense isolation can cause:

* anxiety (see [[overwhelmed]])
* depression
* loss of identity
* paranoia(see [[skeptical]])
* hallucinations
* thoughts of suicide

Granted, most people won’t ever experience the total isolation of solitary confinement. However, long-term social isolation can still lead to many of these symptoms, even without complete solitude.



''How to cope with isolation''
Isolation can happen for many reasons, so some coping strategies may work better for your unique circumstances than others.


A few strategies to consider:


''Go digital''
If you’ve moved far away from loved ones, face-to-face time can become sparse. But thanks to technological advances, you can stay connected through text, email, and video calls.

Research involving older adults in long-term care facilities found even a 5-minute weekly video call with loved ones may significantly reduce loneliness and help people feel more emotionally supported.


''Explore new communities''
Not all friendships and relationships can be salvaged. Maybe you serve as the family scapegoat, most of the people in your friend group regularly make homophobic remarks, or your partner consistently puts you down.

Sometimes, cutting ties with toxic people can do a lot of good for your mental health. If your current social network mistreats you, rest assured that other people out in the world will value and accept you as yourself. It may take some time to find them, but starting that search is an important first step.


''Volunteering''
Making the first overtures toward friendship could help you form new connections more easily.

Consider joining a pen pal program, mentorship group, or community center to reach out to other isolated people around the world.

You can also begin to grow your social circle by volunteering. According to one 2018 study, volunteering in itself can offer an effective way to expand your social network, especially when mourning the loss of a loved one.




''When to get support''
Temporary isolation usually won’t have long-term consequences for your physical or mental well-being, and you can often take steps to manage it on your own.

That said, you may start to notice some effects after weeks or months of isolation. It may be worth considering professional support if you:

* feel intense loneliness most or all of the time
* believe you’re unlovable and don’t deserve companionship
* feel incredibly nervous when you talk to people
* mistrust people by default, even when someone has given you no reason to suspect them
* go out of your way to avoid social interactions and dread the few that are necessary to live your life


A compassionate therapist can help identify possible triggers and work to address both isolation and its impact on your health. Goals of therapy may include:

- improving your self-esteem
- learning and practicing skills to communicate and resolve conflict more effectively
- addressing underlying social anxiety or depression
- processing any trauma that may have triggered isolation, such as bullying or abuse

Apathy is characterized by feeling indifference or emotional numbness towards aspects of life.

If you have been struggling with apathy, there are ways to recognize what’s causing it, to deal with your numbness, and to reconnect with a full range of emotions.

''Identify What Triggers Apathy''
Sometimes it can be hard to tell what the cause is when you feel emotionally numb. Here are some questions to help you identify what’s causing feelings of apathy:

* What was happening in my life just before I started feeling apathetic? Is there a clear starting point?
* What parts of my life make me feel most numb or apathetic? Do I feel apathetic in all aspects of my life, or is it a specific situation or environment that makes me feel this way (for example, a class, or a task at work, or another responsibility)?
* What parts of my life, day, or routine are still engaging to me?
* What about the current apathy-inducing situation is changeable?
* Once you know what triggers your apathy, you can work on changing your reaction to those triggers. If you feel apathetic about everything in your life, and if this feeling has persisted for a while, it’s likely time to seek support from a professional or from trusted members of your social circle.

Sometimes, apathy is the result of a difficult circumstance or event, such as the loss of a loved one, changing schools or jobs, or suffering a financial loss. This is called “situational apathy.” This kind of apathy can also show up when we have a repetitive, unstimulating schedule, don’t feel challenged, or if we feel stuck, overworked or burned out. If you think you are experiencing situational apathy, here are some healthy ways to deal with it:

''Make Lifestyle Changes''
If the feelings of  apathy you experience are  caused by something clearly identifiable, like a repetitive routine or burnout, it can be helpful to change up your routine. Try new things that challenge or fulfill you in different ways, such as a new hobby, a new exercise routine, or making new friends. Pay attention to how each new activity makes you feel. It’s okay to experiment with different things.

''Try Changes at Work or School''
Sometimes it’s work or school that leaves us feeling apathetic. If possible, look for ways to liven up your situation. For example, at school, sign up for classes that you’d be motivated to attend, join clubs that interest you, or find ways to manage your negative feelings around classes you can’t avoid. If you feel apathetic about your career, give yourself time to adjust to a role, find ways to manage the stress of your job, or reassess your career path.

''Set Achievable Goals''
Not all of us can immediately leave or avoid situations that make us feel apathetic, or change our lifestyles completely. It’s okay to start small. Create a to-do list of things you’ve been avoiding, or things you want to try. Set small, achievable goals that can get you moving in the right direction.

''Practice Self-care''
Finding ways to take care of yourself, especially after activities you find especially uninteresting or emotionally taxing, can help you recharge and improve your energy levels. Self-care may also make tackling difficult tasks more bearable.

''Practice Self-compassion''
Apathy can be frustrating to live with, especially when it affects your motivation and keeps you feeling stuck, or it impacts the way you interact with your friends and loved ones. It can also be frustrating if you try some of these coping mechanisms and don’t see the results you were hoping for. It’s important to be gentle with yourself and avoid negative self-talk. Extend yourself the same understanding and compassion that you would give to a struggling friend.

If you’ve made changes to your routine or lifestyle and still feel emotionally numb, disconnected, or unmotivated, it may be time to consider reaching out to a mental health professional for help.


Left unmanaged, feelings of numbness or detachment can turn into feelings of hopelessness, which can escalate into suicidal thoughts if left unaddressed. Look out for these warning signs:

Passive suicidal thoughts, such as “life is pointless” or “I wish I were dead.”
Active suicidal thoughts, such as “I want to end my life” or “I have a plan to kill myself.”
Suicidal behaviors, such as reckless driving, unsafe sex, self-injury, or increased drug use. Suicidal behaviors can also escalate to planning a suicide attempt. For example, saying goodbye to friends and family, writing a suicide note, or finding the means to attempt suicide like stockpiling pills.
If at any point you or someone you know who is struggling with apathy starts to have suicidal thoughts or engage in suicidal behaviors, seek help immediately. Reach out to a mental health professional, a trusted adult, or ''call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 800-273-8255.''

It's normal to feel tired sometimes. But if you're tired all the time and do not know why, it could be a sign of a problem.

Causes of tiredness and fatigue
Common causes of tiredness and fatigue include:

not getting enough sleep or finding it hard to get to sleep (insomnia)
an unhealthy lifestyle (such as having an unhealthy diet and not getting much exercise)

People who are emotionally detached or removed may experience symptoms such as:


* difficulty creating or maintaining personal relationships

* a lack of attention, or appearing preoccupied when around others

* difficulty being loving or affectionate with a family member

* avoiding people, activities, or places because they’re associated with past trauma

* reduced ability to express emotion

* difficulty empathizing with another person’s feelings

* not easily sharing emotions or feelings

* difficulty committing to another person or a relationship

* not making another person a priority when they should be

''What causes emotional detachment?''
Emotional detachment may be voluntary. Some people can choose to remain emotionally removed from a person or situation.

Other times, emotional detachment results from trauma, abuse, or a previous encounter. In these cases, previous events may make it difficult to be open and honest with a friend, loved one, or significant other.

''By choice''
Some people choose to proactively remove themselves from an emotional situation.

This might be an option if you have a family member or a colleague that you know upsets you greatly. You can choose not to engage with the person or persons. This will help you remain cool and keep calm when dealing with them.

In situations like this, emotional detachment is a bit like a protective measure. It helps you prepare for situations that may trigger a negative emotional response.

''As a result of abuse''
Sometimes, emotional detachment may result from traumatic events, such as childhood abuse or neglect. Children who live through abuse or neglect may develop emotional detachment as a means of survival.

When this happens, they may begin to turn off their emotional receptors, as in the case of reactive attachment disorder (RAD). RAD is a condition in which children cannot form bonds with their parents or caregivers.

That can lead to depressed mood, inability to show or share emotions, and behavior problems.

''Other conditions''
Emotional detachment or “numbing” is frequently a symptom of other conditions. You may feel distant from your emotions at times if you have:

* post-traumatic stress disorder
* bipolar disorder
* major depressive disorder
* personality disorders
* Medication

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a type of antidepressant. Some people who take this type of drug may experience emotional blunting or a switched-off emotional center, particularly at higher doses.

This period of emotional detachment may last as long as you take these medications. Doctors can help you find another alternative or help to find the right dosage if the medication affects you in this way.

[[Next]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="66" name="sarcastic" tags="" position="300,1100" size="100,100">Sarcasm comes from the Greek sarkasmos, which means &quot;the tearing of flesh.&quot; The intention behind sarcasm may be to be humorous or playful, but there is frequently an element of poorly disguised hostility or judgment. 


When we grow up in families in which sarcasm is frequently used, there can be an insensitivity to others' sensitivity to it. It can feel hurtful or hostile to the person on the receiving end of it. It frequently diminishes a feeling of trust and safety, provoking feelings of anxiety or defensiveness due to never knowing when the other shoe is going to drop.

''Sarcasm is a thinly veiled attempt to disguise feelings of anger, fear, or hurt.'' 

It can be a means of diminishing feelings of vulnerability that may be experienced in the willingness to acknowledge the underlying feelings. When the deliverer of the sarcasm gets angry or defensive at the recipient of it for “taking things too personally” or being “too sensitive,” they are trying to invalidate the other’s feelings and avoid feeling guilty or responsible for causing them pain.


Sarcasm can be used with playful intent, but it’s important to try to access the other’s sensitivity to it by checking out their response to it and even asking them how they felt about it. Some people come from families where the use of sarcasm was commonplace; and they are used to being spoken to and speaking that way. They do not comprehend how they hurt others with their cutting tongue.


You may be feeling sarcastic for one or more reasons:

1. Insecure( see [[inferior]])
2.Anger( see [[irritated]])
3. Social awkwardness( see [[inferior]])
4. Insecure( see [[embarrassed]])
5. A desire to show superiority( see [[inadequate]])



Is Sarcasm Always Negative?
Sarcasm, often seen as a sharp-tongued cousin of humor, has earned a reputation for being cutting or offensive. Yes, it can be used as a verbal weapon disguised as criticism or even bullying. However, sarcasm also has a brighter side. It can be a form of witty banter between friends, lightening the mood in tense situations and adding a touch of cleverness to conversations.

It all comes down to balance, context, and understanding. Used with finesse, sarcasm can be a flavorful twist to communication, but mishandled, it can leave a bitter taste.

Unfortunately, intense feelings must be recognized and dealt with; they don't just go away on their own.

You may become angry and blame others for what has happened, even though it is not their fault. This is called displaced anger. You may get angry with a higher power, such as God.

Frustration and anger affect people emotionally and physically. You may work out these feelings by talking with someone or through physical activity (such as running, cleaning house, or punching a pillow). Working out frustration and anger in a physical way helps relieve muscle tension and may reduce restlessness and irritation.

Unresolved frustration and anger may grow until you are not able to deal with them. You may then yell, scream, or hit someone or something. Unexpressed frustration and anger can also cause other problems, such as physical illness or depression.

The first step in overcoming frustration and anger is to recognize that you are feeling these emotions. Many people were taught as children not to express frustration and anger. If you are feeling bottled up inside and are not sure what to do about it, try:

* Talking with someone you trust. Talking may help you become more clear about what you are feeling.
* Talking out loud to yourself. You can even use a recorder and play back what you've recorded. This helps you hear yourself express your feelings as though you were listening to someone else.
* Writing about your feelings. It may be helpful to make a list of everything that is bothering you. You can then decide which items you can change and write down ways that you can change them.


Recognizing things that you cannot change. There may be things that you can do nothing about. Simply writing them down is often helpful. Reminding yourself that some things are beyond your control also helps. Letting go of the wish that you could change them may be hard to do. You may need to remind yourself daily or many times throughout the day that these things are beyond your control.
Making changes to help reduce your anger and frustration. For example, if your child's television programs bother you, move the television into a room where you can shut the door. Or you can wear earplugs if noises, such as the television or radio, seem louder than usual.


If you continue to have trouble overcoming your frustration and anger, or if you have had problems with anger in the past, talk about your concerns with someone you trust, such as a clergy person or a health professional. You may decide to join a self-help group or seek counselling.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="68" name="jealousy" tags="" position="300,1300" size="100,100">Jealousy isn’t necessarily an unhealthy emotion, but there are ways to handle your jealousy more constructively.

If you tend to get jealous in romantic relationships, you’re not alone. Jealousy is a very natural emotion that many people experience at some point.

Jealous tendencies can pop up in other situations, too. Research suggests that jealousy is not inherently a bad thing. A 2021 study found, for instance, that friendship jealousy (when a person is threatened by their friend’s new romantic relationship or friend) can help to protect and maintain friendships.

Wherever your jealousy stems from or whom you feel it toward, healing is possible. How do you control jealousy? There are several ways, and some are listed below.

''1. Identify your insecurities''
“Be real with ourselves about what our insecurities are, where they come from, what we do to keep them alive, and what we could potentially start doing to transform them into secure bases of existence,” recommends clinical psychologist Dr. Dena DiNardo, a licensed marriage and family therapist.

To do this, you can journal, meditate, or speak with a therapist. A mental health professional can help you identify the root of your jealousy and how to overcome it.

''2. Communicate openly with your partner''
Consider speaking with your partner about your experience. Opening up about your feelings of jealousy can give them the opportunity to understand where you’re coming from and adjust their behaviors to help you feel more secure within your relationship.

''3. Let go of judgment''
Jealousy has a bad reputation, but it’s not always a negative feeling. DiNardo says to try to stop judging jealousy as a “bad” or “wrong” way to feel because it’s neither.

Jealousy sends us a message about the unhealed parts of ourselves, she adds. “The defensive behaviors we exhibit to protect us from feeling jealous are usually what feel bad or wrong. But the feeling itself is actually a useful tool for us to get to know ourselves better.


''4. Try self-therapy exercises''
Especially if your jealousy comes from toxic past relationships or traumatic situations, coping exercises might help you manage the negative feelings associated with jealousy.



5. Learn more about jealousy
Jealousy almost always has a deeper-rooted emotion behind it. “It can be a manifestation of fear: that we’re not enough, attractive, or interesting, that we won’t be chosen, that other people or things are more important to someone than we are,” says DiNardo.

She lists some other potential sources of jealousy:

- a partner’s ongoing relationships with their exes
not trusting that your partner is committed to your relationship
wishing you had what someone else has (e.g., career, friends, relationships)
- a learned emotional pattern from observing or being raised in an environment heavy with jealousy
conscious or unconscious attachments to competition
- a projection of how we genuinely feel or think about ourselves
a lack of security in the relationship we have with ourselves
losing one or both parents (from divorce, death, or physical, psychological, or emotional abandonment)
- While jealousy is often something internal that we need to work on, that’s not always the case. “Sometimes people want us to be jealous of them or something they have or do because it gives them a false sense of elevation about their own lives. This is something others may or may not be conscious of,” DiNardo adds.



Either way, learning more about yourself can help you better understand where your feelings of jealousy come from and how, based on your personal needs, you can cope with them.

At the heart of skepticism, there are emotional roots, including envy, insecurity, and fear. Envy comes from a sense of inadequacy or comparison with others. When someone who isn’t pursuing their dreams, sees someone who is, it can trigger feelings of envy, leading to skepticism and doubt. When THIS is the root, you have to disregard their skepticism and focus on your own path. There’s nothing you could do or say to get this person’s support other than diminish yourself.

Alternatively, sometimes it’s not envy fueling the skepticism, but trauma instead. This type of skepticism is when individuals project their past experiences onto others, expecting similar outcomes. For example, someone who HAS pursued a dream and ran into an obstacle they couldn’t get past and gave up or “failed” may see your pursuit as a dangerous one. Trauma and fear can cause others to project onto others as a way of “protecting” them from their same fate.




1: Pinpoint your insecurities, and try to notice the ones that are strongest
Before you are able to overcome your doubts, you need to know what they are! Furthermore, knowing your particular weaknesses will help you designate what you should be spending more of your mental energy conquering.

2. Identify your accomplishments
Now, you don’t have to have a Nobel Prize and an Oscar to consider yourself successful. Try to find the hidden, small successes in life. For example, if you read a thick book or cleaned the house instead of watching television, you can say that you are trying to improve yourself and your environment. Not to mention it illustrates that you have great discipline. Ultimately, confidence is all about your outlook on life!

3. Face your fears
Try doing what you are most afraid of. You’ll find out it wasn’t as bad as you thought. By doing something you never thought you would, you will make all of your other insecurities seem relatively insignificant.

4.Take a different view on failure
Don’t treat mistakes as a reflection of your incompetence, but as an opportunity to improve yourself. If you find this difficult use the internet as a source of inspiration- you can always Google a story about a college dropout becoming a billionaire. Clearly there are some ways to bounce back from failure.

 5.Talk to someone
Unload your fears and insecurities and get an objective opinion. When you built something up in your head, you often perceive a scenario to be worse than it is.

6.Be thankful for what you have!
You are an accomplished person in one way or another and there are plenty of positive qualities in you. What’s more, by reading about ways to gain self-confidence you are a proactive person who is taking active steps to improve yourself!


Accepting that your journey will have obstacles and arming yourself with the tools to get through them is what’s going to help you go the distance! Understanding the psychology behind skepticism, envy, and trauma will help you discern which voices to listen to and what type of thoughts to feed yourself. By cultivating self-awareness, empathy, and resilience, my hope is that you can navigate through obstacles and skeptics with grace and determination!
